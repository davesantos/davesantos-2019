I AM :) was a dyed tote bag project by Kayla Bearg and Dominic Santos. A limited batch was exhibited at the [Southern Exposure](https://www.soex.org/) artist sale and sold at [General Store](http://shop-generalstore.com/) San Francisco. I was responsible for designing a logo to be screen printed on the bags.
