Sun on the Sand (2009 – 2013) was a wealth of articles, reviews and events happening in the music industry. The project had over ten contributing music journalist based primarily in Montreal and New York. My role was to manage digital assets, resolve technical issue with the website, and optimized the database as it scaled. I also design user interface for a heavier emphasis on readability.
