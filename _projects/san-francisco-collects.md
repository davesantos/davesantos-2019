San Francisco Collects was an exhibit displaying some of San Francisco art collector's most valued pieces. Curated by Stella Lochman from SFMOMA, the opening was held at [Secret Alley](http://thesecretalley.com). I was responsible for designing the visual identity and typographic treatment for the promotions and wall display.
