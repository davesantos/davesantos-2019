This project is a flexible template built on the Tumblr platform for designers and developers. It was born from the lack of online resources available at the time when developing for clients and friends. It is now the most widely accepted foundation for a template in the open source community. This projects sets itself apart by remaining to be flexible and least opinionated as possible for that need.
