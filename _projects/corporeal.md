This was a book making project was a short biography commemorating Amazon rain forest and human rights activist Chico Mendes. The book covering was casted in latex from a linoleum cut used for print making. The white pigment added was to resemble the milky white rubber extracted from the trees in rubber tapping industry. I designed the entire book from concept to implementation.
